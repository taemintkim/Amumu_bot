Amumu_Bot
=============

  A Reddit bot that scans through a specified subreddit (intended for r/leagueoflegends) for comments containing specific trigger phrases and respond to them accordingly. Unlike other even simpler reply bots, this one has a secondary response.
  i.e. 

    >>> "I'm sad. :'(" by Thomas
  
    >>> "I sense that you are sad. Would you like to be friends?" by Amumu_bot #first response
    
      >>> "Yes." by Thomas
      
        >>> "I thought you'd never pick me. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づⒽⓤⒼ♥" by Amumu_bot #second response to "yes"
        

The triggers, responses, and subreddit can easily changed.
